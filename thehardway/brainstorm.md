Partnerships with key big box retailers like amazon / Best Buy

Incentivize consumers to use the credit card in order to capture the float and earn fees



### Spent online?
> same problem with no clearly defined reward value
> difficult integration with current pos systems
> need big chains to accept it, but hard to agree with them
### Closed network
> why closed? difficulty to implement
> lack of clearly defined reward value
> b2b agreements required

### Don't have fixed value
> causes a lot of the other problems
> required because most rewards are NOT universal, like Amazon's



Affinity mapping

## Mission Impossible
> Earn rewards as a business when people use their card
> What else can people do to make credit companies money?
> A promotion that requires points to enter (eg. mcdonalds monopoly game for pts)
> Analytics across all spending to find best new partners
> Rewards exchange network
> Rewards are / must be a differentiator for the credit card company 

## Earning points
> assumption: by promising points, credit card company can generate more sales, and earn net profit
> $(additional sales due to promised points) > $(cash lost by points redemption)
> goal: maximize perception and minimize actual value of points
